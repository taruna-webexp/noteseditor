# Next.js Note-Taking Application

A simple note-taking application built with Next.js 15 and Quill text editor. This project allows users to create, edit, delete, and auto-save notes to local storage.

## Features

- Local Storage: All notes are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage for persistent data retention.
